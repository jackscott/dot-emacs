DOT EMACS
===========

I've been carrying around emacs configs for a decade now and need to get my shit together.  This is what I use, its ugly, its imperfect, its whatever.

It works for me.


Installation
--------------
You should only have to add a `load` command into your ~/.emacs file

  $ echo '(load "~/path/to/dot-emacs/init.el")' >> ~/.emacs



TODO
-----

 * start using `namespaces` but ran into an issue when trying to import a macro.  Not sure if this is bug or not
 * Clean up everything, remove unused functions/vars
